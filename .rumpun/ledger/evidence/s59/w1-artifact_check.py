"""Independent artifact check (s55 w1).

Closes audit-39's usefulness-decade-1 residual: recorded verdicts establish
what evaluators wrote; they do not independently establish implementation
correctness. This tool re-verifies a named season's landed ships from
artifacts alone:

    python tools/artifact_check.py <sid> <close-commit> [--repo REPO]
                                                   [--out-dir DIR]

1. EXTRACT   git archive the close commit into a temp tree. The live tree
   is never touched (no checkout).
2. PINS      discover the season's merged pins (tests/test_<sid>_*.py) in
   the extracted tree and run them with the repo venv's python, PYTHONPATH
   bound to the extracted src. A resolution probe first proves the import
   resolves into the extracted tree, not the live one.
3. DIGESTS   recompute every claimed pack digest in the extracted tree
   (.rumpun/plugins.yml records vs an independent sha256 over the pack's
   priors/ tree, the s47 convention: sorted pack-relative POSIX paths,
   NUL separators, no trailing separator; empty tree = sha256 of empty
   input) and the season's harvest-record seal (sha256 over the record
   body, lines[4:-1], the akar.append_record convention). plugins.yml is
   read with a minimal indentation-based parser for the yaml.safe_dump
   layout (mapping -> pack name -> scalar leaves); any other shape is a
   structural refusal naming the registry.
4. SHIPS     diff the DESIGN.md ships row for <sid> against the tree:
   split into named-ship clauses (paren-aware), extract checkable claims,
   and judge each clause:
    file claim    a <path>.<suffix> token named in the clause must exist in
   the extracted tree (resolved from the tree root, then src/rumpun/,
   tools/, tests/).
    key tokens    lowercase word+colon tokens ("writers:", "benih:")
   searched verbatim in the tree's src/; the status and first hit are
   recorded. A colon-form miss falls back to the bare word.
    slash tokens  path-shaped tokens without a file suffix
   ("lint/engine/evolve", "musim/"): when every component resolves to a
   module file under src/rumpun/ the clause's key tokens are searched
   inside those files; otherwise the token's last component is searched
   verbatim. When the clause carries a removal marker ("was a", "dead
   path", "found and fixed", "removed", "no longer", "retired",
   "superseded", "renamed away") the legacy token's presence is recorded
   as evidence with its locations: rename back-compat keeps legacy names by
   design, so the removal claim itself is judged by the season's pins.
   Pure-numeric slash tokens ("243/243") are metrics, not surfaces.
    pins claim    "N pins" vs the pytest collected count (binding).
    suite claim   "suite N/M" is recorded verbatim and NOT re-run (the
   season's pins are the check's execution surface; a full extracted-tree
   suite rerun is a future flag).

   close-time fallback (s59): a close's own DESIGN entry postdates the
   commit being checked (the s57 refusal fired live at the s57 close), so
   when the extracted DESIGN.md has no row for <sid> but the live worktree
   DESIGN.md has one, the checker uses the live row and records the fact
   in the check record. The fallback covers ONLY the missing fresh row:
   every other artifact (files, digests, seals) binds to the extracted
   tree exactly as before, so a tampered close still yields DELTA exit 1.

   Per-clause verdict:
    DELTA  a named file is missing, or every surface token absent with no
   removal marker, or the pins count disagrees.
    MATCH  all checkable claims hold. A clause with no machine-checkable
   claims is MATCH-by-prose, recorded verbatim; it is judged by the pins.

5. RECORD    a check-<sid> ledger record (the akar.append_record layout:
   header, body, sha256 trailer over the utf-8 body bytes), written
   atomically to --out-dir (default: the live ledger .rumpun/ledger).
   Append-only: an existing check-<sid> file is refused. The record
   carries: the exact commands run, the pins outcome in the extracted
   tree, the digest comparisons, the ships-row diff (each row MATCH or
   the named delta), and the honest verdict line.

Verdict line in the record and exit code:

    VERIFIED  pins green in the extracted tree, every ships clause MATCH
   or MATCH-by-prose, every digest recomputed equal.
    DELTA     any pins failure, ships DELTA, or digest mismatch (exit 1;
   the deltas are named in the record).
    structural refusal: missing close commit, unknown season id (no ships
   row in the extracted DESIGN.md), no pins file, no tests collected, or
   the import probe failing to resolve into the extracted tree -- exit 2,
   naming the cause.
